; SFX metadata (pointers, priorities, flags)

; Priority of sound. New music or SFX must have a priority higher than or equal
; to what is stored in v_sndprio or it won't play. If bit 7 of new priority is
; set ($80 and up), the new music or SFX will not set its priority -- meaning
; any music or SFX can override it (as long as it can override whatever was
; playing before). Usually, SFX will only override SFX, special SFX ($D0-$DF)
; will only override special SFX and music will only override music.
; Of course, this isn't the case anymore, as priorities no longer apply to
; special SFX or music.
; TODO Maybe I should make it apply to Special SFX, too.
